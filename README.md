## Software Development Lifecycle

## Planning
<!--
### Talking Points
- How are you going to structure your sprints?
- What order are you going to build in?
- How did user research inform your plan?

- Roles
    - What roles did your team take on?
        - Explain the roles and responsibilities of all people working within the software development lifecycle, and how they relate to the project (K2)
    - Did these roles help your team work effectively?
        - Outline how teams work effectively to produce software and how to contribute appropriately (K6)
        - Compare and contrast the requirements of a software development team, and how they would ensure that each member (including themselves) were able to make a contribution (K6)
-->
### User Research Script
<!--
- User
- Requirement analysis
    - How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?
    - Are there any legal or regulatory requirements you should consider?
- Tech spikes
-->
#### Introduction:
    - Thank you for coming. We are Anna, Danilo, Mohamed, Barbara, current fac22. This is our in-house project
    - We are making an app for FAC members, alumni and applicants. They can share YouTube tutorials they enjoyed so that learners don't waste time watching incorrect or outdated content
    - We'd like you to answer as freely, as specifically and honestly as you you are comfortable with. All feedback is useful to us
    - Person2 will be taking notes. We'll use these notes anonymously.
    - The process will take about half an hour. Let us know if you would like a break at any point.
    - If there are any questions you don't want to answer just let us know and we can move on.
#### General Questions:
    - What devices do you mostly use to learn coding? How long have you had/used these devices?
    - What online coding resources do you currently use?/¬†What type of online resources do you use to learn coding (blog, text or video tutorials, discord chats...)
    - What device do you currently use to access YouTube?
    - Is YouTube app installed on your phone?
    - What do you use YouTube for?
        - What kind of videos do you watch?
        - What YouTube features do you use? Make your own Playlists, create Videos...?
    - Do you use captions when you watch Tutorials, what accessibility features are important to you?
    - Have you ever liked, commented, engaged with coding tutorials on YouTube?
#### Specific Questions:
    - What portion of your learning is through tutorial videos? Why do/don't you like videos, why do/don't use it?
    - What coding topics do you most research on YouTube?
    - Would recommendations from other FAC members/alumni make you more likely to watch a video? If so, why?
    - How much time do you spend on researching before you find what you're interested in?
    - What length of videos do you typically watch? Would Timestamps make you more likely to watch a video?
    - Would you find grouping resources by their duration helpful?
    - How do you store information about coding, tutorials? What device, app?
    - How do you structure your YouTube learning - e.g. by topic? Or by individual channel?
    - Do you have any favourite YouTube coding channels?
    - Do you use videos to learn new material or to consolidate previous learnings?
    - What frustrates you about learning to code  online? In general? From YouTube tutorials?


### Wireframing & Prototype

## Analysis
<!--
- Research
    - What did you find out from user testing?
- Project & Outcomes 
    - Did your team work effectively?
    - What would you do differently next time?
    - Were your assumptions right or wrong?
- Conclusions & Recommendations
    - What features would you prioritise to build next?
    - Was the project a success?
- What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?
-->
### User research results
‚úÖ Our research interviews told us that they would find recommendations from other FAC members useful 

‚úÖ They told us that they would like to be able to filter videos by topic and length

‚ùå However, they told us that they didn't find it difficult to find good coding content on YouTube (depending on the topic!)



## Design
<!--
- How did you plan a user experience?
- What technical decisions did you make?
    - Server-render vs client-render vs both
    - Relational or non-relational or no DB
    - Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service
    - Frontend first vs DB first
- Did you create a technical specification?
    - Review methods of software design with reference to functional/technical specifications and apply a justified approach to software development (K11, S11, S12)
-->
### MVP
#### Shrink idea into MVP

- All parts seem connected!
- What features & pages could we live without?
    - User accounts: Log In, Personal Library
    - Big database: Keep it simple for now
- :arrow_right: Simplest MVP :arrow_right: Feed of good videos

## Implementation/Build
<!--
- How did you ensure your code was good?
Create logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. (S1)

- What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?
Outline and apply the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. (K9, S16)

- How did you debug issues that arose?
Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)
-->
### Roles
#### QA: Anna
#### DevOps: Danileo 
#### UX: Mohamed
#### Scrum: Barbara
- How we worked
    - Set Daily Goals
    - Underplan: allow time for bugs
    - Switch between Group, Pair, Individual work
    - Regular **Stand-ups**
        - **Coordinate**: make & allocate tickets
        - **Hand-overs**: merge code in the group


### Design Sprint

#### Challenges
- Multiple uncertainties
    - **Product idea**: Work out what it is, correct scope
    - **Wireframing**
        - What is it for? To test functionality, page flow, layout or design? 
        - What are correct priorities?
    - **Figma**: 
        - How it works
        - How to make it useful to us 
        - Does it beat paper sketches?

-  Feel overwhelmed
    - It's ok to be confused
        - What exactly is confusing? 
        - Ask others! üöÄ
    - :construction: üö®‚ö†Ô∏è:ambulance: at 6pm
        - It's ok to switch off &rarr; we'll fix it tomorrow
        - It probably looks fine & clear to someone else
        - How important is this to final product?

#### What we learned
ü§î How to define the problem our users are facing and design a solution 

ü§î  How to use Figma to create prototypes for testing

ü§î How to conduct user research and usability testing

ü§î How to synthesise user feedback and adjust our project scope and goals

ü§î How to realistically scope our MVP/project


### Build Sprint 1

#### Bugs
- YouTube API 
    - Key: request limits, different request costs
    - Need to hide API key
        ```javascript=
        //.env.local
        NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=...

        // in our files
        const apiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY;
        ```
            - Understanding response body of a fetch request
            - ![](https://i.imgur.com/T5MFD2P.png)
- SWC
    - SWC can be used for both compilation and bundling. For compilation, it takes JavaScript / TypeScript files using modern JavaScript features and outputs valid code that is supported by all major browsers.

    SWC is 20x faster than Babel on a single thread and 70x faster on four cores.
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/HncyXWC.png =600x)

Terminal: Disabled SWC as replacement for Babel because of custom Babel configuration .babelrc 

#### What we learned

- [x] Deployment on Vercel
- [x] How to query the YouTube API with user generated search term (added to state) and output the data onto the page üì∫
- [x] How to find and install relevant components from NPM e.g. ReactPlayer üß©

    import ReactPlayer from 'react-player/youtube';

    <ReactPlayer

        url={`https://www.youtube.com/embed/${video.id.videoId}`}
        />
    ```
- [x] How to use Lodash library function to sort videos by publish date üìÜ
    ```jsx=
    import { orderBy } from 'lodash';

    e.target.value === 'newest' ? (order = 'desc') : (order = 'asc');

        const orderedVideos = orderBy(
          copyVideoData,
          ['snippet.publishTime'],
          [order]
        );
        setVideos(orderedVideos);
      };
    ```
